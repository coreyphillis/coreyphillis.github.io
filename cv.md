# Toolkit #

My workflow involves `R` for data manipulation, statistical analyses, and data presentation, Markdown for composition, RMarkdown for integrating analysis and composition, knitr for pulling it all together, pandoc for exporting to various file types (.tex, .pdf, .docx, etc.), and Git/GitHub for keeping track of it all. I have a working knowledge of JAGS, LaTeX, C++/Rcpp.
